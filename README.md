# Arduino-Graph
Creating an Arduino Program Using Graphs in Visio Drawig.

There is a known method for creating program code using the graph method. The program is represented by vertices (states) interconnected by directed arcs. Arcs contain transition conditions and actions. Vertices (states) can also contain actions in the form of a standard C code.
Graphical objects - vertices (states) and transition arcs are placed in a Microsoft Visio Drawing document.
Clicking the "Translate code C" button creates *.h and *.ino files in the project's directory.
